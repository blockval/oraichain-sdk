:information_desk_person: This repository holds various protocol building blocks of the Oraichain blockchain execution layer and is managed by the [Oraichain Labs](https://orai.io/) team. There is a [chain registry mechanism](./CHAIN_REGISTRY.md) that allows EVM, Cosmos-based, and other L1 blockchains to integrate with the Oraichain ecosystem, including cross-chain bridges and IBC connections.

All libraries are bound together by the core [Common library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@oraichain/common) keeping track of chain specifics and useful helpers. They are complemented by helper packages providing helper functionalities like bigdecimals, transaction parsers, signatures, types and others.
